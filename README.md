# Object-Detection-Project
This project builds an object detection system using deep learning to identify and locate objects in images or video. Trained on a labeled dataset with bounding boxes, the model uses techniques like resizing and normalization. Itâ€™s evaluated with metrics like mean Average Precision (mAP) and IoU, aiming for accurate, real-time deployment.
